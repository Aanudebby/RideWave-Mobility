# RideWave Mobility Report 

## Introduction
The RideWave Mobility project provides an end-to-end analysis of ride-hailing activity across trips, customers, and drivers. Using business intelligence tools, the project explores demand trends, revenue performance, and customer patterns to support smarter business decisions.
The goal is to give RideWave clear insights that help improve customer experience, optimize driver allocation, and boost overall growth.
